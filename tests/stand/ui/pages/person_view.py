"""One person's own view — `/ic/$person_id/personal`. Locators and navigation only.

`$person_id` is the person's canonical UUID since the identity cutover (#2098);
it was the email before. The SPA builds the link with
`encodeURIComponent`, so `@` arrives as `%40`. Encoding it here rather than in a
test keeps the URL shape a property of the view.

Accessibility-first, like every page object here: the published SPA carries no
`data-testid` attributes at all (re-verified across the whole shipped bundle),
so roles and accessible names are the only stable handles.
